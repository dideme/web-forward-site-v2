Main: Unreasonable at Sea is an accelerator program for entrepreneurs who desire to take their ventures into new international markets (it takes place on a boat). The program works exclusively with technology based companies who are working to solve the greatest social and environmental challenges of this century. Why unreasonable? The 100 day accelerator program, created in partnership between the Unreasonable Institute and Stanfordâ€™s d.school, will take place on a ship as it travels more than 25,000 nautical miles, circumnavigating the Southern Hemisphere and porting in 14 countries.
