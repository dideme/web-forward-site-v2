If you are not on our mailing list and wish to be added, please contact us at <a href="mailto:webfwd@mozilla.com">webfwd@mozilla.com</a> and let us know.</p>

<h3>WebFWD History</h3>
<p>We launched WebFWD in 2011 to extend Mozilla's mission through entrepreneurs making the web a better place. What started as a cohort of 2 teams and weekly lectures evolved into a robust, 3-month program of structured curriculum and applied learning for over 33 teams around the world. You can review the portfolio of startups we worked with <a href="/portfolio/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Like Mozilla as a whole, the growth and success of the program was powered by amazing people around the world: mentors, alumni, scouts, partners, subject matter experts, investors, and many more. It's precisely this powerful, mobilized community of people who believe in the power of the web and of entrepreneurship that led us to our next phase. In early 2014 we launched our new platform to broaden the universe of startups that we touch and create more resources to help entrepreneurs get more customers, scale faster and become viable more effectively -- all in a way that makes the web better.</p>
