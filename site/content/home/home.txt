Section2Text1: <p>We launched WebFWD in 2011 to extend Mozilla's mission through entrepreneurs making the web a better place. What started as a cohort of 2 teams and weekly lectures evolved into a robust, 3-month program of structured curriculum and applied learning for over 33 teams around the world. You can review the portfolio of startups we worked with <a href="https://webfwd.org/portfolio/">here.</a> Since 2014, we are not running the 3-month program anymore. We continue to offer the resources we developed at WebFWD to entrepreneurs around the world. </p>
